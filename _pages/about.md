Hello, visitor! I’m Charlie. Thank you for taking a moment to visit my personal page.

Currently, I am a **third year undergrad at UC Berkeley, majoring in [Computer Science](https://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/computer-science/#abouttheprogramtext) and [Data Science](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/data-science/#majorrequirementstext)**. You can find my coursework [here](https://charliejcj.github.io/coursework/). Born in San Jose but raised in the bustling metropolis of Shanghai, I spent a good part of my formative years amidst its vibrant energy. In my academic pursuits, I have developed a keen interest in generative modeling, AI safety, and curious about AGI problems, hoping to make more robust general autonomous systems with little human supervision. Currently, I'm a research intern at Tencent YouTu Lab, working on adversarial machine learning problems in computer vision, specifically in adversarial attacks in facial related applications. There're quite some topics that I'm currently following & exploring, here's a few: **LLM security, LLM + Education, AI + Music**. 

A significant part of my educational journey has been my **love for [teaching](https://charliejcj.github.io/teaching/) and pedagogical theories**. I am an avid proponent of the Concrete-Representational-Abstract, Socratic Teaching, and Multisensory Learning methodologies. 

Outside the sphere of academia, I have been involved in the fast-paced environment of SaaS startups. As a former founding software engineer for [Markit.AI](https://www.markit.ai), I had the privilege of working on image saliency detection for pre-launch analytics as part of the esteemed Skydeck Pad-13 Program.

When I’m not steeped in academics or professional endeavors, I indulge in various activities. [Creating music](https://soundcloud.com/charlie-cheng-jie-ji), teaching, partaking in outdoor events, playing Texas Hold’em poker, and exploring diverse cuisines are some of my passions. I recently start to record my thoughts and experiences in my [blog](https://charliechengjieji.github.io/blog/).
